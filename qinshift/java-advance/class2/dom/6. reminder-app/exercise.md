## Reminder App

- Create a reminder app
- There should be:
  - An input for entering the title
  - An input for entering priority
  - An input for color
  - A textarea for adding a description
  - A button for adding the reminder
  - A button for showing all reminders
- When the button for adding is clicked an object needs to be created with the properties from the inputs ( title,
  priority, color, and description )
- The object should then be added to an array of reminders
- When the button for showing all reminders is clicked it should show a table with title, priority, and description
  columns
- The title should be the color of the "color" property
